20	: show exactly under what circumstances the bee moth succeeds in establishing itself in a hive; thus explaining why some stocks flourish in spite of all neglect, while others, in the common hives, fall a prey to the moth, let their owner be as careful as he will, I shall finally show how in suitable hives, with proper precautions, it may always be kept from seriously annoying the bees.	1
656	If the Apiarian chooses, he can imitate this plan by constructing his hives of very thick plank: but such hives would be clumsy, and with us, expensive.	1

709	If they find them even with field glasses, it counts, provided that the finder can say definitely who it was he spotted.	1
970	Neither our ignorance of all the facts necessary to their full elucidation, nor our inability to harmonize these facts in their mutual relations and dependencies, will justify us in rejecting any truth which God has seen fit to reveal, either in the book of nature, or in His holy word.	1
386	As stated by Justice Jackson, when the Court refused to review an order of the Civil Aeronautics Board, which in effect was a mere recommendation to the President for his final action, To revise or review an administrative decision which has only the force of a recommendation to the President would be to render an advisory opinion in its most obnoxious form advice that the President has not asked, tendered at the demand of a private litigant, on a subject concededly within the President's exclusive, ultimate control.	0

339	Although the Georgia statute prohibited the defendant from testifying under oath, it did not prevent him from entering an unsworn denial both of the contract and of the receipt of any cash advancement thereunder, a factor which, the Court emphasized, was no more controlling than the customary rule of evidence in the Bailey Case.	1

813	Indeed, if the plaintiff had a right which when obtained by grant would have entitled him to covenant, it was open to argument that he should be allowed the same action when he had the right by prescription, although, as has been seen in the case of rent, it did not follow in practice from a man's having a right that he had the contractual remedies for it.	1
859	It is to be noticed that Florus, in his account, says deditione Mancini expiavit.	0
637	If however, the bees when first shaken out of the temporary hive, are so thoroughly sprinkled, as not to be able to take wing and unite together, this mode of forming colonies may be practiced at any hour of the day; and an experienced Apiarian may prefer to do it, as soon as he has fairly hived the new swarm.	1
739	In addition to these the scout should be a lover of his country.	1
437	But the bailee holds in his own as we say, following the Roman idiom, and the servant or agent holding as such does not.	0

993	Not only did the Court take judicial notice of the demands for relief arising from the depression when it overturned prior holdings and sustained minimum wage legislation, but in upholding State legislation designed to protect workers in their efforts to organize and bargain collectively, the Court virtually had to exclude from consideration the employer's contention that such legislation interfered with his liberty of contract in contravention of the due process clause and to exalt as a fundamental right the correlative liberty of employees, which right the State legislatures were declared to be competent to protect against interference from private sources.	1

1026	One of the first acts of Jefferson was his instruction to Secretary of State Madison to withhold commissions to office which remained undelivered.	0
793	In the latter part of Summer, the Apiarian may take away from the main hive, some of the combs which contain the best honey, and replace them with combs into which he has poured the cheaper article; or if he has no spare combs on hand, he may slice off the covers of the cells, drain out the honey, fill the empty combs with West India honey, and return them to the bees: giving them at the same time, the additional food which they need to elaborate wax to seal them over.	1

646	If more than three days went by before the cattle were found, the defendant might swear, if he could, to facts which would disprove the claimant's loss.	0
1055	Prompt protection of the public in such instances is said to outweigh the advantages of a slower procedure, retarded by previous notice and hearing, and to require that the person adversely affected seek his remedy from the Court via a petition to review or to enjoin the decision of the licensing authorities.	0
668	If the defendant foresaw the consequence of his acts, he is chargeable, whether his motive was a desire to induce the other party to act, or simply an unwillingness for private reasons to state the truth.	0

995	Not only should the farmer keep cash accounts, the form may be quite simple, but all his business affairs should be kept in the best possible trim.	0
360	And the coon, pushing it contemptuously away, turned to a pile of fine hand made, deckle edge, heraldry note paper the pride of my friend's heart and when he raised his inky little paws there were left on the paper some beautiful black prints.	1
623	If an inexperienced person wishes to commence bee keeping, I advise him, by all means, to purchase a new swarm of bees.	1
1350	The ringing of bells, and beating of kettles and frying pans, is one of the good old ways more honored by the breach than the observance; it may answer a very good purpose in amusing the children, but I believe that as far as the bees are concerned, it is all time thrown away; and that it is not a whit more efficacious than the custom practiced by some savage tribes, who, when the sun is eclipsed, imagining that it has been swallowed by an enormous dragon, resort to the most frightful noises, to compel his snake ship to disgorge their favorite luminary.	1
613	If a person who cannot write makes a note his mark should be properly witnessed.	1
1288	The owner, therefore, is not to blame, and he cannot even be charged on the ground that the damage was done by his servants.	1
315	After a time even the flight of a bird or its song will be enough to reveal an old acquaintance, just as you can often recognize a boy friend by his walk or the sound of his voice, without seeing his face.	0
654	If running a man down is a trespass when the accident can be referred to the rider's act of spurring, why is it not a tort in every case, as was argued in Vincent v. Stinehour, seeing that it can always be referred more remotely to his act of mounting and taking the horse out?	0
1397	The writ set forth that the defendant undertook to cure the plaintiff's horse of sickness manucepit equum praedicti W. de infirmirate , and did his work so negligently that the horse died.	0

434	But she does not salute when she herself is singing.	0
6	a SERIOUS WOUNDS; b SERIOUS BLEEDING Send for the doctor at once, and then stop the bleeding and keep as clean as possible till he arrives.	1
375	As Chief Justice Vinson recites in his opinion: This action was challenged in Congress on the ground that no specific statute prescribed the method to be used in executing the treaty.	0
371	Are we not compelled to acknowledge that the mathematics must be referred to the Creator, and not to His puny creature?	0
851	It is now a matter of course that the buyer stands in the shoes of the seller, or, in the language of an old law book, that the assign is in a manner quasi successor to his assignor.	1
617	If a scout meets one of another religion, he should remember that he, too, is striving for the best.	1
985	Nor does it apply to statements made by an accused on his own premises to an undercover agent whose identity was not suspected and who had on his person a radio transmitter which communicated the statements to another agent outside the building.	1
1151	The Apiarian cannot be too deeply impressed with the important truth, that his profits in bee keeping will all come from his strong stocks, and that if he cannot manage so as to have such colonies early, he had better let bee keeping alone.	1
1145	The aggregate of the ancestor's rights and duties, or, to use the technical phrase, the total persona sustained by him, was easily separated from his natural personality.	1
1339	The question under discussion was whether the action for running down the plaintiff should not have been case rather than trespass, the defendant founding his objection to trespass on the ground that the injury happened through his neglect, but was not done wilfully.	1
660	If the Apiarian wishes to remove honey from the interior of the hive, he must remove the combs, as directed on page and shake the bees off, on the alighting board, or directly into the hive.	1
1411	There is one point, however, that must be remembered in this feat, and that is that the Transmitter should know just whose hat is held in your hand just who the owner of that particular hat is and where he is sitting or standing.	1
527	From the account Dr. Berg gave me, I felt assured that you had devised substantially the same system as that so successfully pursued by Mr Dzierzon; but how far your hive resembled his I was unable to judge from description alone.	0
831	It has been observed that a bee, in gathering pollen, always confines herself to the same kind of flower on which she begins, even when that is not so abundant as some others.	1
616	If a scout discovers a building to be on fire, he should sound the alarm for the fire department at once.	1
1061	Remedy a Part of the Obligation Suppose, however, that one of the parties to a contract fails to live up to his obligation as thus determined.	0
520	For it can hardly be supposed that a man's responsibility for the consequences of his acts varies as the remedy happens to fall on one side or the other of the penumbra which separates trespass from the action on the case.	0
598	I shall now give some directions, which will greatly assist the Apiarian in his operations.	0
1182	The Court has relied upon this provision in holding that an accused shall plead, or be ordered to plead, or a plea of not guilty be entered for him before his trial proceeds; and in ruling that if the accused is in custody he must be personally present at every stage of the trial where his substantial rights may be affected by the proceedings against him.	1
350	An intelligent Apiarian stated to me this singular fact as occurring in his own Apiary.	1
1480	To complete the order the sender should sign his name in a place indicated for the purpose on the back of the paper.	0
921	Lay the patient flat on his back with head slightly raised.	0

141	Justice Clark bases his position directly upon Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in Little v. Barreme.	0
589	I confess that I find it difficult to repress a smile, when the owner of a few hives, in a district where as many hundreds might be made to prosper, gravely imputes his ill success, to the fact that too many bees are kept in his vicinity	1

1091	So long, at least, as only physical or irresponsible agencies, however unforeseen, co operated with the act complained of to produce the result, the argument which would resolve the case of accidentally striking the plaintiff, when lifting a stick in necessary self defence, adversely to the defendant, would require a decision against him in every case where his act was a factor in the result complained of.	1

860	It is true that the Marshal's case speaks of his negligent keeping when the prisoners were released by rebels, although that was far less likely to result from negligence, one would think, than a fire in the prison, and that after Lord Coke's time negligence was alleged, although the goods had been lost by wrongful taking.	0

893	It will be observed that this case did not go on any special custom, either as to common carriers or shipmasters, but that all the arguments and the opinion of the court assumed that, if the case was to be governed by the common law, and not by the milder provisions of the civil law relied on for the defence, and if the defendant could be regarded as a bailee, and not merely a servant of the owners, then the general law of bailment would apply, and the defendant would be charged, as in Southcote's Case, by his general acceptance.	1

1116	Subsequently, the same provisions have been construed to procure the release of a deputy United States marshal from State custody for killing a man while protecting a Justice of the Supreme Court under a Presidential order which was regarded as a law of the United States; the release of an election official held under State authority for perjury on the ground that jurisdiction to punish a false witness belonged to the federal courts in this instance; and the release of a collector of internal revenue held in Kentucky for his refusal to file copies of his official papers with a State court.	0
787	In the First Employers' Liability Cases, Howard v. Illinois Central R. Co., U.S. , the majority of the Court, speaking through Justice White, gave special attention to the Government's argument that though the act, in terms, governed the liability of every interstate carrier to any of its employees, whether engaged in interstate commerce or not when the liability fell, it was none the less constitutional because one who engaged in interstate commerce thereby submits all his business concerns to the regulating power of Congress.	0

440	But there is this practical difference, that whereas, in most cases, the question of knowledge is a question of the actual condition of the defendant's consciousness, the question of what he might have foreseen is determined by the standard of the prudent man, that is, by general experience.	0

344	An application for an injunction to forbid President Johnson to enforce the Reconstruction Acts, on the ground of their unconstitutionality, was answered by Attorney General Stanbery as follows: It is not upon any peculiar immunity that the individual has who happens to be President; upon any idea that he cannot do wrong; upon any idea that there is any particular sanctity belonging to him as an individual, as is the case with one who has royal blood in his veins; but it is on account of the office that he holds that I say the President of the United States is above the process of any court or the jurisdiction of any court to bring him to account as President.	0

917	Knowing the Birds It is no easy matter, this trying to get to know the birds; but scouts are not looking for the easiest jobs, and it is great sport for them to follow some shy songster through the briery thicket until a really good look can be had, to sit stock still for half an hour to watch some unknown bird come home to her nest, or to wriggle on all fours through the grass to have a glimpse over the top of the knoll at the ducks in the pool beyond.	0
634	If every swarm of bees could be made to yield a profit of dollars a year, and if the Apiarian could be sure of selling his new swarms at the most extravagant prices, he could not, like the growers of mulberry trees, or the breeders of fancy fowls, multiply his stocks so as to meet the demand, however extensive; but would be entirely dependent upon the whims and caprices of his bees; or rather, upon the natural laws which control their swarming.	1

1228	The guaranty of that clause forbids the sentencing of an accused person to prison without a public trial; that is, without a day in court, reasonable notice of the charges, and an opportunity to be heard in one's defense by cross examining other witnesses, or by summoning witnesses to refute the charges against him.	1
361	And therefore it would seem that in such a case the tenant could refuse to pay him rent, and that payment to him would be no defence against the true owner.	1

389	As treason is a crime levelled at the immediate being of the society, when the laws have once ascertained the guilt of the offender, there seems a fitness in referring the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the judgment of the legislature.	1
869	It might be assumed that trespass is founded on the defendant's having caused damage by his act, without regard to negligence.	0
1283	The order and the statute which authorized it were held unconstitutional in a notable opinion by Justice Bradley, as follows: Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man's own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods, is forbidden In this regard the Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other.	0
181	That condition is fulfilled; that is, a State is deemed capable of exerting jurisdiction over an individual if he is physically present within the territory of the State, if he is domiciled in the State although temporarily absent therefrom, or if he has consented to the exercise of jurisdiction over him.	1

157	Justice Butler, joined by Justice McReynolds, concurred in the result, because in his view Tompkins was not entitled to damages under general law, but he deprecated the reversal of Swift v. Tyson.	0
136	Said Justice Reed, in his concurring opinion of the case: The relatively new technique of temporary taking by eminent domain is a most useful administrative device: many properties, such as laundries, or coal mines, or railroads, may be subjected to public operation only for a short time to meet war or emergency needs, and can then be returned to their owners.	0
1377	The teacher is no longer a stimulant to adventurous thinking; she becomes instead a pipe line for safe and sound information.	0
200	In the former the Court ruled that where it appears that the trial court, before accepting pleas of guilty to charges of burglary and larceny by defendants, aged and respectively, advised each of his rights of trial and of the consequences of such a plea, the fact that the record reveals no express offer of counsel would not suffice to show that the accused were deprived of rights essential to the fair hearing required by the due process clause.	1
954	Moreover, for a long time after Henry II., whenever an action was brought for a debt of which there was no written evidence, the plaintiff, when asked what he had to show for it, always answered good suit, and tendered his witnesses, who were sometimes examined by the court.	0
560	Here it plainly appears that the buyer knows exactly what he is going to get, and therefore that the mistake of color has no bearing on the bargain.	1

195	As a basis for distinguishing these last two decisions the Court observed that while the decisions are manifold that within the limits of fairness and reason the burden of proof may be shifted to the defendant even in criminal prosecutions, nevertheless, to be justified, the evidence held to be inculpatory must have had at least a sinister significance , or if this at times be lacking, there must be in any event a manifest disparity in convenience of proof and opportunity for knowledge, Whereas, accordingly, under the terms of the section previously upheld, the defendant could prove his citizenship without trouble, and the State, if forced to disprove his claim, could be relatively helpless, the background of the accused party being known probably only to himself and close relatives, the alleged Japanese defendant, in the last mentioned case, would have suffered hardship and injustice if compelled to prove non Japanese origin, especially since ineligibility renders criminal conduct otherwise lacking in sinister significance occupation of land under lease from an American codefendant .	0
1497	Very often, however, a person in bed is quite able to bathe herself, with a little help, if the necessary things are brought to her.	0
876	It should be noted, however, that if the President fails to act, or if he adopts a narrow construction of a statute which he dislikes, and on this ground professes inability to act, the only remedy available against him is impeachment.	1
822	It also appears that the plaintiff was trying to stand on two grounds; first, privity, as descendant and assign of the covenantee; second, that the service was attached to the manor by covenant or by prescription, and that he could maintain covenant as tenant of the manor, from whichever source the duty arose.	1

177	EFFECT OF AMENDMENT I ON THE COMMON LAW Blackstone was declaring the Common Law of his day, and it was no intention of the framers of Amendment I to change that law.	0
106	The Youngstown Opinion appears to rest on the proposition that since Congress could have ordered the seizure, e.g., under the necessary and proper clause, the President, in making it on his own, usurped legislative power and thereby violated the principle of the Separation of Powers.	0
100	Where property of a citizen has been mistakenly seized by the Government, converted into money and invested, the owner is entitled, in recovering compensation, to an allowance for the use of his property.	1
1214	The first thing to be done, if possible, is to turn off the current by means of the switch, but if this cannot be done at once, the patient must be rescued by pulling him away from the wire.	1
14	It is open to a friendly government to assert that such is the public status of the vessel and to claim her immunity from suit, either through diplomatic channels or, if it chooses, as a claimant in the courts of the United States.	1
66	The constitutional requirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access to the courts of the State upon terms which, in themselves, are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have, even though they may not be technically the same as those accorded to resident citizens.	1
1129	'T is one that he is called upon, nay, constrained by all the obligations that form the bands of society, to discharge sincerely and honestly.	0
994	Not only is the queen much longer lived than the other bees, but she seems to be possessed of greater tenacity of life, so that when any disease overtakes the colony, she is usually among the last to perish.	0
679	If the former ground is adopted, it admits that a single person may sacrifice another to himself, and a fortiori that a people may.	1
197	For want of adequate enjoyment of the right to counsel, the Court, in Powell v. Alabama, overturned the conviction of Negroes who had received sentences of death for rape, and asserted that, at least in capital cases, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him as a necessary requisite of due process of Law.	0
379	As it was punishable to combine for such a purpose, it was concluded, with some hesitation, that, when a single individual wickedly attempted the same thing, he should be liable on similar grounds.	1

399	Before giving directions for feeding bees when a rapid increase of colonies is aimed at, I shall first show in what manner the bee keeper may feed his weak swarms in the Spring.	0
1530	When one must use well water let him note the surrounding drainage.	1
638	If I am right, it appears of little importance whether the post office be regarded as agent or bailee for the offerer, or as a mere box to which he has access.	1
699	If the tax be not paid, the property of the delinquent may be sold, and he be thus deprived of his property.	1
695	If the statute imposed either on the plaintiff himself, or upon the official designated to accept process or some other, the duty of communicating by mail or otherwise with the defendant this requirement is met; but if the act exacts no more than service of process on the local agent, it is unconstitutional, notwithstanding that the defendant may have been personally served in his own State.	1
1483	To give a more specific example, if a surgeon from benevolence cuts the umbilical cord of a newly born child, he cannot stop there and watch the patient bleed to death.	1
1144	The administrator must advertise, in one or more county papers the fact that he has been appointed to settle the estate of the deceased, whose name is given, and he must ask that all claims be presented within a given period, usually fixed at six months.	1
806	In two or three days after giving them the first piece of comb, I give them another, if their queen is nearly mature, and I now let them alone until she ought to be depositing eggs in the hive.	0
891	It will also be noticed in the cases before that time, that there is no settled formula for the obligation in question, but that it is set forth in each case that the defendant was answerable for what he was said to have done or omitted in the particular instance.	1
1223	The government must do two things: it must protect the person and his personal rights as a citizen, and it must also protect property and the rights of property ownership from enemies within, as from without.	1
413	But besides this, for which a condition was not necessary, A may take his choice between two courses.	1
1216	The force did not proceed directly from the defendant, to be sure, but it was brought to bear by the combination of his overloading and then pushing into the stream.	0
738	In a prosecution for a felony, five Justices declared, the defendant has the privilege under the Fourteenth Amendment to be present in his own person whenever his presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.	1
1510	What Scouting Means In all ages there have been scouts, the place of the scout being on the danger line of the army or at the outposts, protecting those of his company who confide in his care.	1
1160	The body of the bleeding President was taken to a house across the street where the next morning at o'clock he died.	0
1004	Of course some of the public may prefer to accept this erroneous theory, but we wish to say here positively that if any person will honestly investigate for himself, and will learn to make the demonstrations personally, he or she will soon discover that muscle reading has nothing to do with the genuine phenomena.	1
723	If, for instance, being assaulted by a third person, the defendant lifted his stick and accidentally hit the plaintiff, who was standing behind him, according to this view he is liable, irrespective of any negligence toward the party injured.	1
719	If you have ammonia or smelling salts, place them before the patient's nose so he may breathe them.	1
1543	When the scout makes signs anywhere for others to read he also draws the head of his animal.	1
1474	Thus, the absence of counsel competent to advise a year old Negro boy of his rights was one of several factors operating in Haley v. Ohio to negative the propriety of admitting in evidence a confession to murder and contributing to the conclusion that the boy's conviction had resulted from proceedings that were unfair.	0
1505	We should call it a contract, but it probably presented itself to the mind of Glanvill's predecessors simply as a duty or obligation attached by law to a transaction which was directed to a different point; just as the liability of a bailee, which is now treated as arising from his undertaking, was originally raised by the law out of the position in which he stood toward third persons.	0
1031	One who is subjected to forced listening is not free in the enjoyment of all his faculties.	1
1013	On the other hand, if a man who was a good rider bought a horse with no appearance of vice and mounted it to ride home, there would be no such apparent danger as to make him answerable if the horse became unruly and did damage.	1
923	Lay the patient flat on his back.	0
232	See his Views of the President of the United States on the Subject of Internal Improvements, of May Richardson, Messages and Papers of the Presidents,	0
416	But he who is intelligent and prudent does not act at his peril, in theory of law.	0
1166	The case was stronger for the plaintiff than if the defendant had been acting in self defence; but the court held that, although the defendant was bound by no duty to separate the dogs, yet, if he was doing a lawful act, he was not liable unless he was wanting in the care which men of ordinary prudence would use under the circumstances, and that the burden was on the plaintiff to prove the want of such care.	0
559	Here it is asserted that the entire executive power is vested in the President; that the power to remove those officers who are to aid him in the execution of the laws is an incident of that power; that the Secretary of the Treasury was such an officer; that the custody of the public property and money was an executive function exercised through the Secretary of the Treasury and his subordinates: that in the performance of these duties the Secretary was subject to the supervision and control of the President: and finally that the act establishing the Bank of the United States did not, as it could not change the relation between the President and Secretary did not release the former from his obligation to see the law faithfully executed nor the latter from the President's supervision and control.	0
645	If it were, every prisoner should be released as soon as it appears clear that he will never repeat his offence, and if he is incurable he should not be punished at all.	1
456	Chief Justice Crew says of this case, in Millen v. Fawdry, that the opinion was that trespass lies, because he did not plead that he did his best endeavor to hinder their falling there; yet this was a hard case.	0
625	If any of the promised traits are wanting in the thing tendered, the buyer may refuse to accept, not merely on the ground that he has not been offered the equivalent for keeping his promise, but also on the ground that he never promised to accept what is offered him.	1
192	There, by a five to four majority, the Court held that the privilege against self incrimination does not extend to books and records which an individual is required to keep to evidence his compliance with lawful regulations.	1
1275	The observations of the judicious Blackstone, in reference to the latter, are well worthy of recital: To bereave a man of life, says he or by violence to confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of arbitrary government.	0
653	If proof be added that the defendant knew of his son's instructions, preparation and plans, the purpose to aid and comfort the enemy becomes clear.	0
965	My wish for every Girl Scout who undertakes a garden is that she may have all these satisfactions, and may follow all these delightful paths that lead to knowledge, and through knowledge to joy.	0
1347	The rescuer must act very promptly, for the danger to the person in contact is much increased the longer the electric current is allowed to pass through his body.	1
1482	To do this, place the hands on either side of the drowning person's head, and tow him floating on his back with the face above the surface of the water, while you swim on your back and keep the body away from you.	1
39	Liberties Pertaining to Education of Teachers, Parents, Pupils . A State law forbidding the teaching in any private denominational, parochial, or public school, of any modern language, other than English, to any child who has not successfully passed the eighth grade was declared, in Meyer v. Nebraska to be an unconstitutional interference with the right of a foreign language teacher to teach and of parents to engage him so to instruct their children.	1
1527	When conditions show the speaker that this is the case, as it did here, there certainly comes a point beyond which he cannot indulge in provocations to violence without being answerable to society.	0
941	Mann, however, strongly resented the charge that he was opposed to religious instruction in the public schools.	0
443	But, according to the testimony, the defendant signed without knowing that the plaintiff was to alter his position in any way on the faith of the signature, and it was held that, if that story was believed, there was no consideration.	0
898	It would, however, be arrant dogmatism, quite outside the scope of our authority in passing on the powers of a State, for us to deny that the Illinois legislature may warrantably believe that a man's job and his educational opportunities and the dignity accorded him may depend as much on the reputation of the racial and religious group to which he willy nilly belongs, as on his own merits.	0
1115	Subsequently A is sued by B in their home State, and offers the judgment, which he has in the meantime paid, in defense.	1
67	Justice McReynolds, speaking for the dissenting Justices, labelled the controls imposed by the challenged statute as a fanciful scheme to protect the farmer against undue exactions by prescribing the price at which milk disposed of by him at will may be resold.	0
1467	Thus, a State has inherent power to require every able bodied man within its jurisdiction to labor for a reasonable time on public roads near his residence without direct compensation.	0
1291	The patient may or may not be unconscious, but he may take no notice of what is going on around him.	1
911	Justly has he been called the Colossus of the Revolution.	0
287	A right to defeat a just debt by the statute of limitation not being a vested right, such as is protected by the Constitution, accordingly no offense against the Fourteenth Amendment is committed by revival, through an extension or repeal, of an action on an implied obligation to pay a child for the use of her property, or a suit to recover the purchase price of securities sold in violation of a Blue Sky Law, or a right of an employee to seek, on account of the aggravation of a former injury, an additional award out of a State administered fund.	1
1500	We are to ask what are the elements, on the defendant's side, which must all be present before liability is possible, and the presence of which will commonly make him liable if damage follows.	0
794	In the laws adapted by the Thuringians from the earlier sources, it is provided in terms that the master is to pay for all damage done by his slaves.	0
715	If this should not be done, then it would be well to keep it in the safe of the bank in which the testator has his account.	1
925	Let the boy remember also that in addition to courage, unselfishness, and fair dealing, he must have efficiency, he must have knowledge, he must cultivate a sound body and a good mind, and train himself so that he can act with quick decision in any crisis that may arise.	0
850	It is not necessary, after this evidence that the modern heir began by representing his ancestor generally, to seek for expressions in later books, since his position has been limited.	1
1470	Thus, if the tax on animals be a fixed sum per head, or on articles a fixed sum per yard, or bushel, or gallon, there is nothing the owner can do which can affect the amount to be collected from him.	1
261	A defendant could clear himself of the felony by their oath that he had bought or received the thing openly in the way appointed by law.	1
1316	The President felt himself in a dilemma, whether if it was by statute the duty of the District Attorney to prosecute or not, the President could interfere and direct whether to proceed or not.	0
1406	There can be no doubt that the learned judge who presided would have taken the opinion of the jury on that ground, if he had been requested so to do.	0
1461	Three principal questions arise: first, how does the President exercise the powers which the Constitution or the statutes confer upon him; second, in what relation does he stand by virtue of the take care clause to the powers of other executive, or administrative agencies; third, in what relation does he stand to the enforcement of the criminal laws of the United States?	1
1577	The more direction an actor gets, the worse he performs.	1
450	By the aid of such hives, some of the most intelligent citizens of Philadelphia have seen in my Apiary, the queen bee depositing her eggs in the cells, and constantly surrounded by an affectionate circle of her devoted children.	1
144	Again, in discussing the President's power of removal, he maintained that the wanton removal from office of meritorious officers would be an act of maladministration, and would render the President liable to impeachment.	0
358	AND she must also have planted and cultivated a small vegetable garden like the one described in the Handbook, in the Section The Girl Scout's Own Garden OR B.	0
981	No matter where a man's personal property is placed, the rule is to tax him for the whole at the place of his usual residence.	1
442	But when the former possessor has already gained a right of way before he is turned out, a new principle comes into operation.	1
1022	One is that he lives in doors for the greater part of the time, and the other is that he must attend school, which is pretty largely a matter of sitting still.	0
1423	These occurrences have given rise to the two common sayings, viz., Speak of the devil and his imps appear, or Speak of angels and you hear the rustle of their wings.	0
1206	The extremity of the sting being barbed like an arrow, the bee can seldom withdraw it, if the substance into which she darts it is at all tenacious.	0
724	If, for lack of means, the debtor is unable to discharge his debt, his sureties shall be answerable for it.	1
178	Hearing. The necessity and expediency of a taking being legislative questions irrespective of who may be charged with their decision, a hearing thereon need not be afforded; but the mode of determining the compensation payable to an owner must be such as to furnish him with an opportunity to be heard.	1
565	Horace Mann was opposed to sectarian doctrinal instruction in the schools, but he repeatedly urged the teaching of the elements of religion common to all of the Christian sects.	0
95	THE JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION In short, when the subject matter of a suit is merely the determination of the defendant's liability, it is necessary that it should appear from the record that the defendant had been brought within the jurisdiction of the court by personal service of process, or his voluntary appearance, or that he had in some manner authorized the proceeding.	1
878	It should enable him to catch the queen, for any purpose; especially to remove an old one whose fertility is impaired by age, that her place may be supplied with a young one.	0
1148	The answer is: Long ago the beasts learned the dire lesson man is our worst enemy; shun him at any price.	0
59	The right of a State to the fisheries within its borders he then held to be in the nature of a property right, held by the State for the use of the citizens thereof; the State was under no obligation to grant co tenancy in the common property of the State, to the citizens of all the other States.	1
1184	The Creator intended the bee for the comfort of man, as truly as he did the horse or the cow.	0
1438	This I have repeatedly witnessed in my observing hives, and admired the sagacity of the queen in economizing her necessary work after this fashion, instead of laboriously depositing the eggs in cells where they are not wanted.	0
1399	Then the thief should hide his spoil in a safe place about the room.	1
1231	The heir, as the general representative of his ancestor's rights and obligations, was liable for his debts, and was the proper person to sue for those which were due the estate.	1
1566	Wrist Grip Of these the simplest is the one where the wrists of the swimmer have been grasped by the drowning man in his struggles.	0
924	Let it make no difference, banker, merchant, kinsman or friend, do not fear to give offence, but right then and there, count the money he gave you.	1
1053	PRESIDENTIAL IMMUNITY FROM JUDICIAL DIRECTION By the decision of the Court in State of Mississippi v. Johnson, in the President was put beyond the reach of judicial direction in the exercise of any of his powers, whether constitutional or statutory, political or otherwise.	0
1365	The signature of the bail was not necessary, and it was not requisite that the person bailed should bind himself as a party.	1

836	It is a definite handicap to the colored student to confine his association in the Law School with people of his own class, said the opinion of Judge Morris A.	0
702	If the time is not specified, a partner may withdraw whenever he pleases.	1
128	And to implement such prohibition, a State has the power to declare that places where liquor is manufactured or kept shall be deemed common nuisances; and even to subject an innocent owner to the forfeiture of his property for the acts of a wrongdoer.	1
592	I have frequently, by holding a queen in the closed hand, caused her to make the same noise.	0
218	Thus, where on the day assigned for hearing of a writ of error, it appeared that the accused had escaped from jail, the Court, without denial of due process, could order that the writ be dismissed unless the accused surrender himself within days or be captured. Allen v. Georgia, U.S. .	1
754	In favor of A, the contract is conditional on B's keeping his agreement to employ him.	1
1412	There is such a fascination in making the rubbing stick fire that one of my Western cooks, becoming an expert, gave up the use of matches for a time and lit his morning fire with the fire drill, and, indeed, he did not find it much slower than the usual way.	0
445	But, having the money for a paid up policy, could not the young man, without any expense for clerk hire or rent, invest it, and reinvest it with the interest, as long as he lived, and thus make by insuring himself?	0
1143	The administrator must account for every item of property that comes into his possession.	0
899	It, therefore, follows that the date on which the governor approved the ratification, or the date on which the secretary of state of a given State certified the ratification, or the date on which the Secretary of State of the United States received a copy of said certificate, or the date on which he proclaimed that the amendment had been ratified are not controlling.	0
1561	Within the limits just explained the heir was also bound to warrant property sold by his ancestor to the purchaser and his heirs.	0
348	An industrious scout may often make his own pocket money in this way or provide funds towards his own education.	1
322	Again, it might be said that, if the defendant's intent or neglect was essential to his liability, the absence of both would deprive his act of the character of a trespass, and ought therefore to be admissible under the general issue.	1
314	Admiral Farragut is reported as giving this explanation, in the late years of his life, of his success in the service of his country It was all owing to a resolution that I formed when I was ten years old.	0
134	OATH OF OFFICE What is the time relationship between a President's assumption of office and his taking the oath?	1
730	If, when the question of the defendant's negligence is left to a jury, negligence does not mean the actual state of the defendant's mind, but a failure to act as a prudent man of average intelligence would have done, he is required to conform to an objective standard at his peril, even in that case.	1
363	Another consideration affecting the argument that the law as to trespasses upon property establishes a general principle, is that the defendant's knowledge or ignorance of the plaintiff's title is likely to lie wholly in his own breast, and therefore hardly admits of satisfactory proof.	1
1433	They sought him through all the ranks, and every time they met one of these officers they thought they had come face to face with the king.	0
297	A serious objection to natural swarming, is the discouraging fact that the bees often refuse to swarm at all, and the Apiarian finds it impossible to multiply his colonies with any certainty or rapidity, even although he may find himself in all respects favorably situated for the cultivation of bees, and may be exceedingly anxious to engage in the business on a much more extensive scale.	1
1311	The poem itself is descriptive of what the author saw and felt on the night of September as he watched the bombardment of Fort McHenry by the British during the War of	1

239	Wrist Grip If the drowning person grasps the rescuer's wrists, the rescuer throws both hands above his head, which forces both low in the water, and then turns the leverage of his arms against the other's thumbs and breaks the grip.	1

570	How long does it take to do it?	0
142	The Court further indicated that the same principle would apply to an application for a mandamus ordering the President to exercise any of his powers.	0
502	Even the strongest horse could not pull a wagon with his teeth very far, or pull something tied only to the back leg muscles.	0
875	It should be noted that Justice Holmes couples with his invocation of the clear and present danger test in his dissent in this case the contention that rightly construed the act of Congress involved The Espionage Act of May Stat.	0
77	Justice Sutherland's later assertion in the Curtiss Wright case that the powers to declare and wage war, to conclude peace, to make treaties, etc., belong to the Federal Government as the necessary concomitants of nationality leaves even less room for the notion of a limited treaty making power, as indeed appears from his further statement that as a member of the family of nations, the right and power of the United States are equal to the right and power of the other members of the international family.	0
1532	When Senate Consent Is Complete Early in January, the Senate requested President Hoover to return its resolution notifying him that it advised and consented to certain nominations to the Federal Power Commission.	0

256	A certificate may be presented from a Domestic Science teacher, or from the mother if the Captain knows her and can testify to her competency to judge.	0
101	For the same reason, a State may not prevent a citizen from concluding with a foreign life insurance company at its home office a policy loan agreement whereby the policy of his life is pledged as collateral security for a cash loan to become due upon default in payment of premiums, in which case the entire policy reserve might be applied to discharge the indebtedness.	1
1215	The following table is given for frequent reference use by the Girl Scout while earning her badges in Homecraft.	0
534	Give me the same latitude claimed by such objectors, and I can easily prove that a man is under no obligation to receive any of the wonders in the economy of the bee hive, although he is himself an intelligent eye witness that they are all substantial verities.	0
1376	The swimmer throws both hands above his head which forces both low in the water and then turns the leverage of his arms against the other's thumbs, breaking the hold easily.	1
894	It will be seen that in each of these well known cases the court assumed a rule which would make the defendant liable if his conduct was such as the evidence tended to prove.	1
262	A depositor, when opening an account with a bank is required to place his signature in a book kept for the purpose.	1
477	Dissenting for himself and Justices Black and Rutledge, Justice Douglas declared that, under the authority of Williams v. Kaiser, U.S. , if the defendant is not capable of making his own defense, it is the duty of the Court, at least in capital cases, to appoint counsel, whether requested so to do or not.	0
1351	The rule already prevailed, which has been borrowed and adopted by the English statutes and by our own act of Congress of according to which the owner is discharged from responsibility for wrongful acts of a master appointed by himself upon surrendering his interest in the vessel and the freight which she had earned.	1
599	I should feel but little confidence in being able to reinstate bee keeping in our country, into a certain and profitable pursuit, if I could not show the Apiarian in what way he can safely bid defiance to the pestiferous assaults of this, his most implacable enemy.	1

809	In Wakeman v. Robinson,another runaway case, there was evidence that the defendant pulled the wrong rein, and that he ought to have kept a straight course.	0
151	IMPACT OF THE PRIZE CASES ON WORLD WARS I AND II In brief, the powers claimable for the President under the Commander in Chief clause at a time of wide spread insurrection were equated with his powers under the clause at a time when the United States is engaged in a formally declared foreign war; and impliedly vice versa.	0
1448	This old earth of ours has not always been as we see her to day.	1
118	Water A statute making it unlawful for a riparian owner to divert water into another State does not deprive him of property without due process of law.	1
1475	Thus, when the defendant chased sheep out of his land with a dog, and as soon as the sheep were out called in his dog, but the dog pursued them into adjoining land, the chasing of the sheep beyond the defendant's line was held no trespass, because the nature of a dog is such that he cannot be ruled suddenly.	0
1252	The leader in taking his patrol out to the spot drops scouts at convenient distances, who will then act as runners from one post to the next and back.	0
354	An owner out of possession could sue the wrongful taker of his property, as well as one who had possession.	1
23	Consistently with this view, federal courts more recently have declared that when local party authorities, acting pursuant to regulations prescribed by a party's State executive committee, refused to permit a Negro, on account of his race, to vote in a primary to select candidates for the office of United States Senator, they deprived him of a right secured to him by the Constitution and laws, in violation of this amendment.	1

1345	The recognition of God as the ruling and leading power in the universe, and the grateful acknowledgement of His favors and blessings is necessary to the best type of citizenship and is a wholesome thing in the education of the growing boy.	1
418	But if insanity of a pronounced type exists, manifestly incapacitating the sufferer from complying with the rule which he has broken, good sense would require it to be admitted as an excuse.	0

671	If the defendant was a servant not having control over the goods, he might not fall within the law of bailment, and factors are treated on the footing of servants in the early law.	1
43	However, in an unacknowledged departure from this ruling the Court has subsequently held that the full faith and credit clause did not preclude California from disregarding a Massachusetts workmen's compensation statute and applying its own conflicting act in the case of an injury suffered by a Massachusetts employee of a Massachusetts employer while in California in the course of his employment.	0

1052	PRESIDENTIAL DIPLOMATIC AGENTS What the President may have lost in consequence of the intervention of Congress in this field, he has made good through his early conceded right to employ, in the discharge of his diplomatic function, so called special, personal, or secret agents without consulting the Senate.	0
832	It has been said, for instance, in this connection, that a carrier is a servant; while nothing can be clearer than that, while goods are in custody, they are in his possession.	1
1456	This was the first instance of a master being made unconditionally liable for the wrongs of his servant.	1
16	When a suspect speaks because he is overborne, it is immaterial whether he has been subjected to a physical or a mental ordeal.	1
469	Conversely, the President is not obliged by this clause to impart information which, in his judgment, should in the public interest be withheld.	0
324	Again, the real substance of the defence is not that the damage was not intended, that would be no defence at all; but that, whether it was intended or not, that is, even if the defendant foresaw it and foresaw it with pleasure, the manifest facts and circumstances under which he said it were such that the law considered the damage to the plaintiff of less importance than the benefit of free speaking.	1
1147	The anomalous distinction according to which, if the servant receives the thing from another person for his master, the servant has the possession, and so cannot commit theft, is made more rational by the old cases.	1

663	If the bee keeper wishes to see their innate capabilities fully developed, let him rear a lot for himself among some old combs, and if prizes were offered for fat and full grown worms, he might easily obtain one.	1
530	Furthermore, as formerly the defendant's public calling had the same effect as an assumpsit for the purpose of charging him in tort, it seems now to have been thought an equally good substitute for a special promise, in order to charge him in assumpsit.	1
991	Not one of them offers any remedy for the loss of the queen, or indeed for most of the casualties to which bees are exposed: they form no reliable basis for any new system of management; and hence the cultivation of bees, is substantially where it was, fifty years ago, and the Apiarian as entirely dependent as ever, upon all the whims and caprices of an insect which may be made completely subject to his control.	0

1551	Where the gravity of the crime and other factors such as the age and education of the defendant, the conduct of the court or the prosecuting officials, and the complicated nature of the offense charged and the possible defenses thereto render criminal proceedings without counsel so apt to result in injustice as to be fundamentally unfair, the latter group majority holds that the accused must have legal assistance under the amendment whether he pleads guilty or elects to stand trial, whether he requests counsel or not.	1
1555	While regretting that the trial court has not had the testimony read or repeated to the accused, the Supreme Court held that a deaf person is not deprived of due process of law because he had not heard a word of the evidence.	1

1242	The judge must banish the slightest personal impulse to reprisal, but he should not bend backward and injure the authority of the court by too great leniency.	0
182	Similarly, in a suit against a local partnership, in which the resident partner was duly served with process and the nonresident partner was served only with notice, a judgment thus obtained is binding upon the firm and the resident partner, but is not a personal judgment against the nonresident and cannot be enforced by execution against his individual property.	0

863	It is, says the analytical jurist, because, although he was not negligent at the moment of escape, he was guilty of remote heedlessness, or negligence, or fault, in having such a creature at all.	0
1495	Until Reagan v. Farmers' Loan and Trust Company the Court maintained a distinction between the duty imposed upon an official by the general laws of the State and the duty imposed by a specific unconstitutional statute and held that whereas an injunction would not lie to restrain a State official from enforcing an act alleged to be unconstitutional in pursuance of the general duties of his office, it would lie to restrain him from performing special duties vested in him by an unconstitutional statute.	1
1011	On the contrary, the seven Justices maintained that although a State legislature may prescribe a form of procedure to be observed in the taking of private property for public use, it is not due process of law if provision be not made for compensation The mere form of the proceeding instituted against the owner, , cannot convert the process used into due process of law, if the necessary result be to deprive him of his property without compensation.	1

199	That record included only the indictment, the judgment on the plea of guilty to a charge of murder, the minute entry bearing on the sentence, and the sentence, together with a lengthy recital in the judgment to the effect that when the defendant expressed a desire to plead guilty the Court explained to him the consequence of such plea, his rights in the premises, especially, his rights to have a lawyer appointed to defend him and to be tried before a jury, and the degree of proof required for an acquittal under a not guilty plea, but that the defendant persisted in his plea of guilty.	0
439	But the philosophical analysis of every wrong begins by determining what the defendant has actually chosen, that is to say, what his voluntary act or conduct has been, and what consequences he has actually contemplated as flowing from them, and then goes on to determine what dangers attended either the conduct under the known circumstances, or its contemplated consequence under the contemplated circumstances.	1

989	Nor was any attention given the fact that Lincoln had asked Congress to ratify and confirm his acts, which Congress promptly did, with the exception of his suspension of the habeas corpus privilege which was regarded by many as attributable to the President in the situation then existing, by virtue of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.	0

78	PROCEDURE FOR REMOVAL Only after a person has been charged with crime in the regular course of judicial proceedings is the governor of a State entitled to make demand for his return from another State.	1
365	Another way to remind himself is to wear his scout badge reversed until he has done his good turn.	0
835	It has often been said that malice is one of the elements of liability, and the doctrine is commonly stated in this way: that malice must exist, but that it is presumed by law from the mere speaking of the words; that again you may rebut this presumption of malice by showing that the words were spoken under circumstances which made the communication privileged, as, for instance, by a lawyer in the necessary course of his argument, or by a person answering in good faith to inquiries as to the character of a former servant, and then, it is said, the plaintiff may meet this defence in some cases by showing that the words were spoken with actual malice.	1
1038	Or was it begun from the apprehension that she might again be removed?	0
552	He wrote: I am aware of course that the word intent as vaguely used in ordinary legal discussion means no more than knowledge at the time of the act that the consequences said to be intended will ensue.	0
1045	Pending his arrival the scout should remember to treat the sufferer for shock as well as to dress the wound.	1
1127	Suppose that a defendant were allowed to testify that, before acting, he considered carefully what would be the conduct of a prudent man under the circumstances, and, having formed the best judgment he could, acted accordingly.	1
28	But, as shown above, a naturalized citizen is subject at any time to have his good faith in taking the oath of allegiance to the United States inquired into, and to lose his citizenship if lack of such faith is shown in proper proceedings.	1
359	And so we Scouts, not to lose this great spirit, study the stars and the sun and the trees and try to learn a few of the wood secrets she knew so well.	0

430	But no one has any idea how cross, crooked, and contrary a creature can be, until he wishes it to repeat for him some ordinary things that it has hitherto done hourly.	1
1518	When a judge rules that there is no evidence of negligence, he does something more than is embraced in an ordinary ruling that there is no evidence of a fact.	1
745	In detinue the plea was that the plaintiff delivered the defendant a chest locked with his key, that the chattels were in the chest, and that they were taken from the defendant together with his own goods by robbery.	1
693	If the seller is introduced by the name B, and the buyer supposes him to be another person of the same name, and under that impression delivers his written promise to buy of B, the B to whom the writing is delivered is the contractee, if any one is, and, notwithstanding what has been said of the use of proper names, I should suppose a contract would be made.	0
175	However, there must be something more than an ordinary honest mistake of law in the proceedings for compensation before a party can make out that the State has deprived him of his property unconstitutionally.	1
881	It was a proceeding to recover those compositions, at first optional, afterwards compulsory, by which a wrong doer bought the spear from his side.	1

1375	The Supreme Court has said that the constitutional guarantee of liberty 'embraces not only the right of a person to be free from physical restraint, but the right to be free in the enjoyment of all his faculties .'	1
117	To recur to the case of rights acquired by prescription, every universal successor could add the time of his predecessor's adverse use to his own in order to make out the right.	1
1415	There may have been some hesitation as to robbery when the robber was unknown, and so the bailee had no remedy over, or even as to robbery generally, on the ground that by reason of the felony the bailee could not go against either the robber's body or his estate; for the one was hanged and the other forfeited.	1
86	However, mandamus proceedings to compel a State official to perform a plain or ministerial duty which admits of no discretion are not suits against the State since the official is regarded as acting in his individual capacity in failing to act according to law.	1
248	while the court ruled with regard to the defendant's conduct as has been mentioned, it held that whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in not having vaccinated his children was a question of fact, and was properly left to the jury.	1
180	MODIFICATION OF TARIFF LAWS This point was raised again in Field v. Clark, where the Tariff Act of was assailed as unconstitutional because it directed the President to suspend the free importation of enumerated commodities for such time as he shall deem just if he found that other countries imposed upon agricultural or other products of the United States duties or other exactions which he may deem to be reciprocally unequal and unjust.	0

1460	Those cases which attribute possession to a transferee of goods in the hands of a middleman, without distinguishing whether the middleman holds in his own name or the buyer's, are generally right in the result, no doubt, but have added to the confusion of thought upon the subject.	0
193	Pleas in Abatement. State legislation which forbids a defendant to come into court and challenge the validity of service upon him in a personal action without thereby surrendering himself to the jurisdiction of the Court, but which does not restrain him from protecting his substantive rights against enforcement of a judgment rendered without service of process, is constitutional and does not deprive him of property without due process of law.	1

714	If this only meant that the promisor alone must bear the legal burden which his promise may create, it would be true.	1
670	If the defendant lighted an ordinary fire in a fireplace in an adjoining house, having no knowledge that the fireplace was unsafely constructed, the court would probably rule that he was not liable.	0

1076	Scouts are the birds' police, and wo betide the lad who is caught with a nest and eggs, or the limp corpse of some feathered songster that he has slaughtered.	0
1196	The difference taken in Gibbons v. Pepper, cited above, is not between results which are and those which are not the consequences of the defendant's acts: it is between consequences which he was bound as a reasonable man to contemplate, and those which he was not.	0
1056	Provided, the Court has said, a substantial or efficacious remedy remains or is given, by means of which a party can enforce his rights under the contract, the Legislature may modify or change existing remedies or prescribe new modes of procedure.	0

784	In the course of the debate on the act to establish a Department of Foreign Affairs later changed to Department of State all of these views were put forward, with the final result that a clause was incorporated in the measure which implied, as pointed out above, that the head of the department would be removable by the President at his discretion.	0
387	As the President himself had requested the resolution, the episode supports the theory that international conventions to which the United States is party, even those terminable on notice, are terminable only by act of Congress.	0
1576	A person must reside continuously in the Territory for years before she may apply for permanent residence.	1

466	CONGRESSIONAL REPEAL OF TREATIES It is in respect to his contention that when it is asked to carry a treaty into effect Congress has the constitutional right, and indeed the duty, to determine the matter according to its own ideas of what is expedient, that Madison has been most completely vindicated by developments.	1

546	He is ignorant, that is to say, that the true owner either has or claims any interest in the property in question, and therefore he does not intend a wrongful act, because he does not mean to deal with his neighbor's property.	0
